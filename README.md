## Description

Portfolio website to showcase my talents as a front-end web developer with deep interests in learning new things and ReactJS. This was my first introduction to myself on Jamstack. Most of all the entries can be edited through Sanity as more skills and abilties evolve. One reason why I chose Gatsby was for speed and SEO.

#### Technologies used
